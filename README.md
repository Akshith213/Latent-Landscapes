# Image Embeddings Exploration and Style Manipulation Using Diffusion Models

## üìö Overview
Welcome to the Image Embeddings Exploration and Style Manipulation Using Diffusion Models project! This project explores the latent space of image embeddings generated from a CLIP-based model. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering, and leveraging diffusion models, we aim to understand the underlying structures and styles within the embedding space. We demonstrate how manipulating these embeddings can influence the generated images, enabling style transfer and new image synthesis.

### üéØ Objectives
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce high-dimensional image embeddings using PCA to capture the most significant variance.
- **Latent Space Exploration:** Visualize the impact of principal components on image generation to understand their influence on visual features.
- **Clustering:** Identify clusters within the embedding space to discover groups with similar styles or content.
- **Style Manipulation:** Manipulate styles extracted from principal components to synthesize new images and demonstrate style transfer.
- **Visualization:** Generate meaningful visualizations to illustrate findings and patterns within the embeddings.
